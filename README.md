# House-Votes-Project
I trained a model to predict the party of US Congress members based on their votes on different issues using the US Congressional Voting Records (1984) 
I cleaned the data, 
set my feature and target data, 
split the data, 
fit the model on the train dataset, 
predicted the model using the test dataset and 
evaluated the model using AUC
